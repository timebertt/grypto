// DLog32 calculates the discrete logarithm of x to the given base and modulus by enumeration for int32 numbers.
// The discrete logarithm of a number x to the base of b modulo m is defined as the smallest number y,
// so that b^y â‰¡ x mod m. DLog32 is the inverse operation to Pow32.
// Enumeration is a very simple approach to calculate dlog. It calculates b^i for i=0,1,...,m until b^i=x.
// While being simple, the algorithm can take up to order(b) steps in the worst case, so it is very impractical
// for bases with large order.
// Calculating the discrete logarithm is thought to be hard, so currently there is no known algorithm for solving
// it efficiently. The security of some cryptographic algorithms (e.g. Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal and others) is based
// on exactly this assumption, that DLog32 is hard.
